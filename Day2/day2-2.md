# Day 2 Notes
* Notes starting at 4:56:30

## Emulator
* From last time, stuck with problem of loading the ELF.
  * Only care about the LOAD headers.
* Compiled `test_app` has different file size on my machine vs. Gamozolab's.
  * This is reflected in the code.
* After file loading is done, need to be able to run RISCV instructions.

### Registers
* 32 registers for 64 bit

NOTE: Stopped at 6:07:21 on Day 2 for now
