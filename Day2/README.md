# Day 2 Notes

Day 2 is split into 3 note files (because it took me 3 separate 
sessions to get through the material.)

## main.rs
Rust fuzzer

## emulator/*
RISC-V emulator progress through the 3 sessions.

I did not reorganize the files like Brandon Falk. The resulting 
code from Day 2 can be found @ [this commit from Brandon](https://github.com/gamozolabs/fuzz_with_emus/tree/5fc5b6bec091cd7330b649c0b1d470076dd1a2e2).
